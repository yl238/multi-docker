# Multi-Container Deployments to AWS

Code for the [Docker and Kubernetes course](https://user-testing.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide) on Udemy. This builds a simple React app that calculates the Fibonacci number Fib(_i_) of index _i_. Some additional complexity has been introduced by the use of Postgres and Redis databases to store the inputs and outputs. The final app requires co-ordination of multiple containers. 

Note that Travis CI has been replaced with Github Actions.
